# User Interface / User Experience 

Our course scheduler will be a web-based. A user will navigate to our website, and will be prompted with the [sample interface](ui.png). The user will enter their desired courses for the their term of choice, and hit the generate button. An [arrangement of courses](ui_sample-usage.png) will be displayed on the calendar to the right.

The drop down box underneath the course entries will allow for the user to choose what _type_ of schedule they want. In other words, they will be able to choose if they would like their courses to be close together; if they want to avoid scheduling courses at a certain time slot; or if they don't really care as long as they get as many of the courses they can.
